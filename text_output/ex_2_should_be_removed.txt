As can be seen the mass terms of the tensor modes of torsion and included in the
action are whereas the vector and axial modes remain This re sult with the case
of quadratic MAG the solution a mass term for the axial mode of torsion alone

turns out that the gian density ( 118) the following interaction terms when
ﬁxing the of the simplicity in the presentation we omit another constant a

addition there are several special cases for c which can also introduce a mass

that the vector and axial modes of the model are free of while of the ( 175)

this work we have explicitly shown that the extension of the gra MAG in the
presence of cubic order dened from the cu torsion and a safe framework for the
